# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
generally this model would be more effetcive since it uses a training set of data to account for possible biases in larger datasets and to check for possible overfitting/underfitting occurring 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
My r^2 value varies everytime that the model is ran, meaning that underfitting is occuring.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that given a larger data set that my model would probably be moderately effective, similar to the last model. Although, since the data set is so small any amount of data used would result in innacuracy, or underfitting. This is characterized by a high bias and low variance shown within the final model. 
*take into account that these concepts are new to me, so my commentary is probably wrong, although at this point this is what I think

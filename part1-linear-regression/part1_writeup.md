# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
the r^2 val is 0.6257932855322312, this says that the precision of model is questionable, given that around 38% of variablilty in the data cannot be accounted for, so most results would be off by a decent margin.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
the prediction is a value of 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
the data itself has a bias since there isnt a sufficent amount of data given for each age to really find the accurate measurements of systolic blood pressure. I would increase the amount of data gathered, so that the model can give a more accurate reading.
